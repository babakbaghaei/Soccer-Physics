// This file (main.js) was previously used for testing a power-up system.
// The power-up system has been removed as per user request.
// This file's content has been cleared to reflect that.
// The main game logic is in game.js.

// If index.html still loads this file, it will now do nothing significant.
// Consider updating index.html to load game.js directly if this was the intended entry point,
// or remove the script tag for main.js if it's no longer needed.
// For now, game.js initializes itself via DOMContentLoaded.
